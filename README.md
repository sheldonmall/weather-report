# This is homework for: Unit 06 Server-Side-APIs

## Website URL

My day planner website can be found at: https://sheldonmall.github.io/weather-report/


## Installation

There are no specific steps to install this website, nor are there any installable tools on this website, as of now.


## Usage 

This website is for: **Weather Report**. 

The usage of this application is described below:

* When the page loads, this is what shows on the landing page: 
- An input field on the top-left to enter the `City` for weather search.
- A box on the bottom-left to show a history of cities previously searched, if any.
- A box on the top-right to display the weather conditions for the entered / selected city.
- A box on the bottom-right to display the 5-day weather forecast icons for the entered / selected city.
 
* The application works as given below:
- In the top-left box, enter the name of the city for which to search the weather.
- Click on the `Submit` button to initiate weather search for the specified city. 
- The current weather conditions for the searched city are reported in the top-right box.
- There is no response from the application if `Submit` is clicked on a blank `City` field.
- If the specified city name was not searched previously, it will be added to the list of previously searched cities and displayed in bottom-left box. If the city had been searched previously, it is not added again.
- Clicking on a city name from the list of previously searched cities performs the same function as entering a city name in the search field.
- 5-day forecast for the selected city is displayed in the bottom-right box.

My Task list for developing this application:

[x] Building the required page

## Tests

My website is simple to use. 

The website is fully working and I am  able to complete all requirements. Initially I struggled with the .on("click" function to select a city and display the weather connditions for that city. I sought help from my TA and tutor to help me get this right.

I will continue to improve the code work after this assignment is submitted.
